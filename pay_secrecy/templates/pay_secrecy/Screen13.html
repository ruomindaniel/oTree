    <p>
    At the end of each period, employee and manager bonuses are calculated. The firm makes a profit of 1 point per unit of firm output.  If Employees A, B, and C produced 40, 60, and 80 units respectively, then firm output will be 180 units. A portion of the total profit is available to be paid as bonuses to the manager and the employees.
    </p>
    <p>
    The manager receives a fixed portion of the firm output. Thus, the higher the firm output generated by the employees, the higher will also be the manager’s bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
    The employee bonus consists of two parts:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li class = 'list'>
            <b>Individual Bonus</b>: it is based on the employee’s individual output; each employee will earn 15% of his/her output, subject to the uncontrollable shock (if any). For instance, if an employee produced 60 units in the period, the individual bonus will be 9 points (60 * 15%).
        </li>
        {% if pay_transparent == 1 %}
        <li class = 'list'>
            <b>Shared Bonus</b>: it is from a bonus pool; The manager can distribute the bonus pool in any way, but cannot keep for themselves any bonus designated for employees.
        </li>
        {% else %}
        <li class = 'list'>
            <b>Shared Bonus</b>: it is from a bonus pool; a portion of the firm output will be added to an employee bonus pool, which will be distributed among the three employees by the manager. Therefore, the higher the total firm output, the larger the employee bonus pool. The manager can distribute the bonus pool in any way, but cannot keep for themselves any bonus designated for employees.
        </li>
        {% endif %}
    </ol>
