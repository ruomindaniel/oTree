        The employee bonus pool will be distributed among the three employees by the Manager.
        Specifically, the Manager will allocate the bonus pool by entering the bonus amounts, in points, in the computer.  The sum of the three bonuses must equal the total employee bonus and no employee can receive less than zero.
